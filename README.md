# cloudwatch-metrics
Collects cloudwatch metrics and forward them to logz.io, based on opentelemetry collector
We simplify the data export and collection for your metrics: You tell us the desired namespaces and regions you want to send your data from and we fetch the most relevant metrics to display in the Logz.io pre-built Infrastructure Monitoring dashboards.

### **Note:**
* Extra calls and charges on AWS API requests may be generated by this project.

* You can track the number of AWS API requests with the `cloudwatch_requests_total` metric, which provides labels with the API name and namespace specification. For example :
  `cloudwatch_requests_total{action="getMetricStatistics",namespace="AWS/EC2",} 876.0`.

* For more information about the prom/cloudwatch-exporter cost, refer to the relevant [Prometheus documentation](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter#cost) and to the [AWS cloudwatch API pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/).

#### Before you begin


##### Set up your IAM user

You'll need an [IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home)
with the following permissions:

* `cloudwatch:ListMetrics`
* `cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics`
* `tag:GetResources`

If you don't have one, set that up now.

Create an **Access key ID** and **Secret access key** for the IAM user,
and paste them in your text editor.

##### Get your metrics region

You'll need to specify the AWS region you're collecting metrics from.

![AWS region menu](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/aws/region-menu.png)

Find your region's slug in the region menu
(in the top menu, on the right side).

For example:
The slug for US East (N. Virginia)
is "us-east-1", and the slug for Canada (Central) is "ca-central-1".

### Quick start with environment variables
```shell
docker run --name cloudwach-metrics \
-e TOKEN=<<TOKEN>> \
-e LOGZIO_REGION=<<LOGZIO_REGION>> \
-e AWS_REGION=<<AWS_REGION>> \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>> \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>> \
-e AWS_NAMESPACES=<<AWS_NAMESPACES>> \
logzio/cloudwach-metrics
```

#### Full list of configurable environment variables

| Environment variable | Description |
|---|---|
| AWS_REGION (Required) | Your region's slug. You can find this in the AWS Console region menu (in the top menu, to the right).  **Note:** This is the region that you will collect metrics from. |
| LOGZIO_REGION (Required)| Your Logz.io region code. For example if your region is US, then your region code is `us`. You can find your region code here: https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html#regions-and-urls. |
| TOKEN (Required)| Token for shipping metrics to your Logz.io account. Find it under Settings > Manage accounts. [_How do I look up my Metrics account token?_](/user-guide/accounts/finding-your-metrics-account-token/) |
| AWS_NAMESPACES (Required) | Comma-separated list of namespaces of the metrics you want to collect. You can find a complete list of namespaces at [_AWS Services That Publish CloudWatch Metrics_](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html).   **Note:** This Environment variable is required unless you define the `CUSTOM_CONFIG` Environment variable |
| SCRAPE_INTERVAL | The time interval (in seconds) during which the Cloudwatch exporter retrieves metrics from Cloudwatch, and the Opentelemtry collector scrapes and sends the metrics to Logz.io. Default = `300`.   **Note:** This value must be a multiple of 60.|
| P8S_LOGZIO_NAME | The value of the `p8s_logzio_name` external label. This variable identifies which Prometheus environment the metrics arriving at Logz.io came from. Default = `logzio-cloudwatch-metrics`.  |
| CUSTOM_CONFIG | Mount your cloudwatch exporter configuration file `-v pathToConfig/config.yml:config_files/cloudwatch.yml` and set to `true` if you want to use custom configuration for cloudwatch exporter, Default = `false` |
| CUSTOM_LISTENER | Set a custom URL to ship metrics to (for example, http://localhost:9200). This overrides the `LOGZIO_REGION` Environment variable. |
| SCRAPE_TIMEOUT | The time to wait before throttling a scrape request to cloudwatch exporter, Default = `120`|
| REMOTE_TIMEOUT | the time to wait before throttling remote write post request to logz.io, Default = `120`|
| LOG_LEVEL | Opentelemetry log level, Default = `debug` |
| LOGZIO_LOG_LEVEL | `builder.py` Python script log level. Default = `info` |
| AWS_ROLE_ARN | Your IAM role to assume. |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | Your IAM user's access key ID. |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | Your IAM user's secret key. |
| SET_TIMESTAMP | Boolean for whether to set the Prometheus metric timestamp as the original Cloudwatch timestamp. Default = `false` |
| PERIOD_SECONDS | period to request the metric for. Only the most recent data point is used. Default = `300` |
| RANGE_SECONDS | how far back to request data for. Useful for cases such as Billing metrics that are only set every few hours. Default = `300` |
| DELAY_SECONDS | The newest data to request. Used to avoid collecting data that has not fully converged. Default = `300` |

### Run with configuration file
Create `config.yml` file:
```yaml
otel:
  # your logz.io region
  logzio_region: "us"
  # custom listener address
  custom_listener: ""
  # environment tag that will be attached to all samples
  p8s_logzio_name: "cloudwatch-metrics"
  # your logz.io metrics token
  token: ""
  # the time to wait between scrape requests
  scrape_interval: 300
  # the time to wait before throttling remote write post request to logz.io
  remote_timeout: 120
  # the time to wait before throttling a scrape request to cloudwatch exporter
  scrape_timeout: 120
  # opentelemetry log level
  log_level: "debug"
  # python script log level
  logzio_log_level: "info"
  # aws credentials
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ""
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ""
cloudwatch:
  # set to true if you are loading a custom configuration file for cloudwatch exporter
  custom_config: "false"
  # your cloudwatch aws region
  region: "us-east-1"
  # role arn to assume
  role_arn: ""
  # list of aws cloudwatch namespaces to monitor
  aws_namespaces: []
  # The newest data to request. Used to avoid collecting data that has not fully converged
  delay_seconds: 300
  # how far back to request data for. Useful for cases such as Billing metrics that are only set every few hours
  range_seconds: 300
  # period to request the metric for. Only the most recent data point is used
  period_seconds: 300
  # boolean for whether to set the Prometheus metric timestamp as the original Cloudwatch timestamp
  set_timestamp: "false"
```
Mount the configuration file to your container:
```shell
docker run --name cloudwach-metrics \
-v <<path_to_config_file>>:/config_files/config.yml \
logzio/cloudwach-metrics
```

### Run with custom cloudwatch exporter configuration
Create `cloudwatch.yml` file (for details refer to [prom/cloudwatch_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/cloudwatch_exporter#configuration) project),
and mount the configuration file to your container and set `CUSTOM_CONFIG` variable to `true`
```shell
docker run --name cloudwach-metrics \
-e TOKEN=<<TOKEN>> \
-e LOGZIO_REGION=<<LOGZIO_REGION>> \
-e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>> \
-e CUSTOM_CONFIG=true \
-e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>> \
-v <<path_to_cloudwatch_config_file>>:/config_files/cloudwatch.yml \
logzio/cloudwach-metrics
```
### Publish extension ports
You can monitor the container using opentelemetry extensions in the following ports:
* 8888 - `opentelemetry metrics`
* 55679 - `Zpages`
* 13133 - `Health check`
* 1777 - `Pprof`
You can also publish the ports to your host network by using the `-p` flag
  
```shell
docker run --name cloudwach-metrics \
-v <<path_to_config_file>>:config_files/config.yml \
-p 8888:8888 \
-p 55679:55679 \
-p 13133:13133 \
-p 1777:1777 \
